Emotion Detection Using FER and Deep Learning
This project uses facial emotion recognition (FER) to analyze emotions in images and videos. It implements a convolutional neural network (CNN) for detecting seven emotions—angry, disgust, fear, happy, neutral, sad, and surprise—and provides a demonstration using the FER library and OpenCV for both image and video inputs.

Project Overview
Features:
Emotion Detection in Images: Detect emotions using the FER library and display confidence scores.
Real-Time Emotion Detection in Videos: Process each frame in a video file to recognize emotions in real time and save the output.
Deep Learning Model: A custom CNN model trained on the FER2013 dataset to detect emotions in grayscale images.
Requirements

pip install -r requirements.txt
Data Preparation
Download the FER2013 dataset from Kaggle or any other source.
Store the dataset in a designated directory and ensure your data paths are correctly configured in the script.
File Descriptions
Image Emotion Detection: Code for analyzing static images to detect emotions and print confidence levels.
Video Emotion Detection: Code for processing videos frame-by-frame to detect and annotate emotions in real time.
Model Training Script: Script to train a custom CNN on the FER2013 dataset, using data augmentation and dropout for improved accuracy.
Confusion Matrix Plotting: Script to generate a normalized confusion matrix for model evaluation.
Getting Started
1. Image Emotion Detection
Run image_emotion_detection.py to load an image and detect the primary emotion.
Example usage:
python
Copy code
python image_emotion_detection.py --image_path "../path_to_image.png"
2. Video Emotion Detection
Run video_emotion_detection.py to process a video file and output an annotated video with detected emotions.
Example usage:
python
Copy code
python video_emotion_detection.py --video_path "../path_to_video.mp4"
3. Model Training
Run train_emotion_model.py to train a custom CNN model on the FER2013 dataset and evaluate its accuracy and loss metrics.
4. Confusion Matrix
Run plot_confusion_matrix.py to visualize model performance across each emotion class.
Adding a Video to Your README
To add a video demonstrating your project to your GitHub README:
